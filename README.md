# minimal-electron-typescript-react-2020
A minimal typescript based electron and react app boilerplate for 2020. No test suites, no redux, just electron, react, typescript, and webpack

This repo is on the cutting edge of releases as of December 2020. If you are reviewing the repo after that time you may wish to make changes.

## Why

There were a lot of bloated boilerplates that included test runners, outdated ECMAscript settings, and tons of base files that I didn't need.
The goal of this repo is to provide a stripped down starting point that you can then add to while getting something up and running quickly.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo via `git clone git@github.com:gravyboat/minimal-electron-typescript-react-2020.git <yourDir>`
2. Run `npm install` (this repo is using Node 15.3.0)
3. Run `npm start`

At this point you should have an Electron window with your app component inside. You can now add Babel, Sass, Jest or whatever else you desire.
